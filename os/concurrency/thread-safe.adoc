[CAUTION]
.CRUX: HOW TO ADD LOCKS TO DATA STRUCTURES
====
When given a particular data structure, how should we add locks to it, in order to make it work correctly?
Further, how do we add locks such that the data structure yields high performance, enabling many threads to access the structure at once, i.e., *concurrently*?
