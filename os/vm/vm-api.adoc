.Two types of memory
stack memory::
* allocated and deallocated _implicitly_ by compiler
* automatically managed
heap memory::
* allocated and deallocated _explicitly_ by programmer

.Commons errors
* Forgetting to allocate memory
* Not allocating enough enough
* Forgetting to initialize allocated memory
* Forget to free memory
* *Dangling pointer:* use after free
* *Double free:* free memory repeatedly
* Calling `free()` incorrectly
