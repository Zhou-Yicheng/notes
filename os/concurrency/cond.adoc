= Condition Variables

[CAUTION]
.THE CRUX : HOW TO WAIT FOR A CONDITION
====
In multi-threaded programs, it is often useful for a thread to wait for some condition to become true before proceeding.
The simple approach, of just spinning until the condition becomes true, is grossly inefficient and wastes CPU cycles, and in some cases, can be incorrect.
Thus, how should a thread wait for a condition?
