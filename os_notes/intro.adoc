= Introduction to Operating Systems

OS takes a *physical* resource and transforms it into a more general, powerful, and easy-to-use *virtual* form.

.Three roles of the OS
* Virtual machine
* Standard library
* Resource manager

== Virtualizing CPU

* OS creates a *illusion* that each process runs on its private own processor by time sharing the CPU.

== Virtualizing Memory

* OS creates a *virtual address space* for each process by sharing the physical memory.

== Concurrency

* Concurrency allows OS to make lots of decision at the same time.
* Concurrency allows programs to run more than one function concurrently.

== Persistence

* OS stores data on the hardware persistently in the form of *files*.
* Files are managed on the storage device by *file system*.
